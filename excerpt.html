            <p><h1>JAMES</h1></p>
            <p>Everyone was complaining about the never ending winter.</p>
            <p>It seemed as though winter was here to stay and blew winds that tugged at the hats and scarves of any who dared to go outside.</p>
            <p>But there were those who rebelled.</p>
            <p>Down the sidewalk came a young teen who was doing tricks on a skateboard.  He wore only tennis shoes and board shorts that were stamped with letters spelling, “IOMBALUC.”  He had a perfectly sculpted six pack and was clearly showing it off.  Completely bundled up girls ooh’ed and ahh’ed as he passed and he replied to them with winks.</p> 
            <p><i>To think, such a person represents this advanced institution</i>, James thought, as the skateboarder passed him, hit an upturned cobblestone, and completely wiped out.</p> 
            <p>“Serves him right, I don’t know why skateboarding is allowed in <i>my</i> city. . . .”  James muttered to himself.  He redoubled his grip on his leather briefcase, fixed his oversized, horn-rimmed glasses, and then ran his hand through his brown hair.  After walking another block, he turned right, and entered the iron-wrought gates that opened to the heart of the Iombaluc campus.</p> 
            <p>The gates opened to a double-wide path containing a throng of students, professors, and city natives alike.  Iombaluc was situated on an expansive, mile by quarter-mile sized plot of land, at the beginning of Uptown Manhattan.  Greek revival buildings formed a perimeter around the rectangular-shaped campus, with many open, green spaces dotted throughout.</p> 
            <p>James weaved through the crowds, walking at a brisk pace.</p> 
            <p>He tended to arrive to everything early, and an important midterm required that he at least be seated, the middle of the front row as always, an hour in advance.</p> 
            <p>After climbing many hills and steps, and dodging other students who dared to wear shorts in twenty-five degree weather, James finally arrived at Rikai Hall.</p> 
            <p>The two-hundred-year old, three-story tall structure was formed in red brick with white, limestone accents.  The wide building had four doric columns; behind them lay a ten-foot high, double wooden door which stood beneath a stone, triangular frieze upheld by the columns.  The frieze summoned a very ominous feeling within James:  It depicted a throng of humans drowning in a river beneath a ferry carrying three people.  The three saved souls were draped in airy garments and each of their faces wore a foreboding expression.</p>
            <p>James quickly entered the building, ejecting the image of the frieze from his mind, not wanting any negative thoughts to affect his performance.</p>
            <p>Ten stairs lay immediately in front of the dimly-lit entrance; they led to a small, marble landing which contained another set of stairs, branching to the left and right.  James took the right, one flight up, and stopped in front of the first door at the top of the landing.</p> 
            <p>The classroom door had a poster plastered to it that read, “Vote Whitney Glokette for class president.”  Being captain of the water polo team, Whitney’s picture of course depicted him in nothing but a skin tight speedo.  James then, of course, briefly remembered happening to once see exactly what was <i>underneath</i> the speedo in the locker room.  He turned completely red.</p> 
            <p>James quickly tried to bury the rush of excitement that had reached his brain (and another member of his body) and entered the classroom.</p> 
            <p>He was not the first to arrive.</p> 
            <p>There were already three students in the bright, forty-seat room.  Each was frantically flipping through what looked like a year’s worth of notes.</p> 
            <p>James took the middle seat in the front row, retrieving a novel titled, <i>The Will of Osiris</i>, from his briefcase and began to calmly read.  He smirked to himself—he did not need to do any cramming.</p> 
            <p>Organic Chemistry was a college-level course and notorious for being one of the toughest classes at Iombaluc.  It chewed geniuses up and spat them out.  But not James.</p> 
            <p>Because of his height, he was generally able to blend in with the other college students, but his baby face and bowl haircut usually gave him away.  However, that did not bother James.  While being the only high school student in a college class would overwhelm most people, he relished in the fact.</p>
            <p>He had achieved an A plus the first semester while the rest of the class had averaged a C minus.</p>
            <p>“How do you do it?”  asked students, when seeing James’s cupid visage and perfect scores at the top of exams that he had conveniently left out for all wandering eyes to see.</p> 
            <p>“I pay close attention in class,” he would wisely inform them, always receiving incredulous looks in return.</p> 
            <p>After reading for forty-five minutes, James’s ears noticed the fluttering of flipping pages, and he looked up to see the room now packed with over thirty students; all of them were cramming like those who had first arrived.</p> 
            <p>James caught the eyes of the professor, who was already at the front of the room, seated at his desk while the teaching assistants passed out the exam.  The middle-aged, balding man winked at him, which James returned with a nod.</p> 
            <p>Professor Sodio was one of many professors who adored James.  He had never seen a student like him in his entire twenty years of tenure—he likely wondered if James understood his field better than he did.  On occasion, he even allowed James to teach in his absence, ranking him higher than even the graduate teaching assistants.</p> 
            <p>An exam now lay on every desk, a student sitting in every other seat.</p> 
            <p>“I’m going to fail!”  cried one girl, just before the start of the exam.  Breaking into tears, she stood up and ran out of the room; if she ever returned, James did not notice.</p> 
            <p>The hour-hand of the clock, high on the front wall of the room, behind the professor struck the number one.</p>
            <p>“Begin,” said Professor Sodio.</p>
            <p>A rapid shuffling of pages filled the air as students ripped opened their exams, knowing they would need every second.</p> 
            <p>James slowly broke the seal of the test booklet and, with a number two pencil poised in his left hand, began writing in his blue book.</p> 
            <p>Within forty-five minutes, James was more than half-way done through the three-hour exam.  He felt jubilant, like he could tackle anything:  The master of the universe.  He stretched and chanced a glance at the male student two seats to the right;  the poor soul was only on page two of ten of the exam—surely, he would not finish in time.</p> 
            <p>James then looked to the left, where he saw an Asian girl with silky black hair, quietly reading a novel—her exam booklet closed.</p> 
            <p><i>Probably accepted the fact that she was going to fail, regardless</i>, James reasoned, as he knew there was a huge gulf between him and the second best student.</p> 
            <p>Not wanting to be mistaken as a cheater, he returned his eyes to the problem at the top of page seven of his test booklet.</p> 
            <p>He stared in horror.</p> 
            <p>The problem was a simple balancing equation.  It was a high-school Chemistry question—the professor had likely thrown it in to give the students some free points.</p>
            <p>However, despite its simplicity, the equation looked as foreign to James as it would to any non-science person.</p>
            <p>The hour-hand of the clock struck the number two.</p> 
            <p>James still stared, stupidly, at the question.  He had yet to write anything.  He couldn’t figure out why the problem that he had done hundreds of times had now not made any sense.  And then he remembered his trump card.</p> 
            <p><i>I guess it’s not really cheating</i>, thought James, finally giving in and closing his two human eyes as he opened his third.</p> 
            <p>It was just as fascinating as the first time he had done it.</p> 
            <p>The phantom organ felt like a collection of energy that was an extension of his soul, floating in midair in front of his forehead.  James moved his left hand there but, like always, felt nothing.</p> 
            <p>He turned his head side to side, the third eye following, and saw the students as always—but they were <i>different</i>.  From the way their bodies moved and muscles flexed, he could visualize their arteries pumping blood from their anxious hearts.  As they furiously wrote down solutions, he could see an intense, rippling glow around their brains.  The heads of the students appeared almost transparent—the brain could clearly be seen.  The glow surrounding the brain reminded James of the soft glow of a firefly.</p> 
            <p>The third eye had manifested in James nearly a month prior, during class.  He had just received his Quantum Mechanics examination back, the top page stamped with the grade, “99%.”</p> 
            <p>The shock of the non-perfect score had triggered a panic attack, and next thing he knew, James was in the hospital with an IV in his arm.  He awoke to his parent’s voices, yet despite the fact that his eyes were closed, he could still <i>see</i> them.  He reasoned that he was delirious from the attack, as it did not make sense for him to see his mother and father’s brain as they spoke.</p>
            <p>But over the next couple of weeks, he realized the truth of the matter.</p>
            <p>Every time he went to bed, it took him hours to fall asleep.  For when his eyes would close, a second vision would open.</p> 
            <p>But unlike a normal person, James did not panic.  He did not think this was magic or God-like intervention.  Nor did he reason that the panic attack may have triggered this new power.  He thought of evolution.</p> 
            <p>Surely this eye had manifested in other humans of immense intelligence, like himself.  There were probably others before him who had the eye; others who, like him, were unable to share this sixth sense with the world for fear of persecution or exile.</p> 
            <p>The following weeks James had methodically tested the eye, learning its mechanics and gaining its knowledge.  But he had never used it on an exam; despite the eye’s indications of the many errors in human understanding, James was not sure whether or not to entirely rely on it. Though, now he remembered his ideas of evolution.  Using the third eye was the only path.</p> 
            <p>After looking at Professor Sodio, whose brain-glow was slightly dimmer than that of the students; James focused his second sight back on the exam.</p> 
            <p>Now he saw why the simple problem had defeated him.  It was all wrong—the questions, the concepts, the ideas—the whole study of Chemistry.</p> 
            <p>James flipped through his earlier answers.  Yes, all wrong—wrong answers, wrong questions.  The eye not only saw the truth, it knew the truth; it had imparted James with knowledge beyond human comprehension.  Excited, he began deeply editing.</p> 
            <p>Forty minutes later, James’s completed exam lay on his desk, entirely covered in erasures and rewriting.  He had crossed out every question and completely reworded them, and each new answer challenged the quotidian thinking of science.</p>
            <p>Unable to further edit the midterm, James got up to hand it in; he received an odd glance from Professor Sodio when passing him the reworked and hastily scribbled-over exam.  It was then that James realized that he was smiling at the professor with his normal eyes closed, and also realizing how crazy he must’ve looked, quickly opened them.  The professor finally thanked him and returned his focus to his desk,  allowing James to further analyze him with his new eye.</p>
            <p>He once again saw the blue glow.  The glow was strongest at the top of the head, where it shot upwards into a foot long string, thinning until it could no longer be seen.  However, the energy emanating from the old man’s brain was flickering, as though it were about to be extinguished.  Slightly disturbed from the flashing of the dying light, James quickly turned around, returned to his desk, packed his briefcase, and left the classroom.</p> 
            <p>And then he had an idea.</p> 
            <p>He wondered how he had never thought of this.  James ran down the hallway and quickly entered a private bathroom.  There, he used his new vision to gaze at his reflection in the oval-shaped glass.</p> 
            <p>There it was—floating, right in front of his forehead—a perfect orb, encased in blue flame.  It did not look like a human eye, but more like a golfball-sized, blue sun.  It reminded James of a scorching, supergiant star.</p> 
            <p>Through the eye, James not only saw his reflected physical body, but his flesh pulsating:  The indication of the adrenaline coursing through every nerve.  He focused again on his head where he saw the blue glow—a brother flame to the eye—enclosing his entire head in a bubble, ending in a stick-like string on top.</p> 
            <p>His eye then saw the reflection of a clock behind him.  It was all black with white hands.  And with a jolt, James remembered Qlo, with that awful flame inside her chest.</p> 
            <p>She had disappeared for an entire month.  James had last met up with her the morning of his panic attack.  He had called her repeatedly that evening, but Qlo never answered.  While James was worried about his friend, figuring out his evolution was a more important task.  Things such as best friends could wait.</p> 
            <p>And then out of nowhere, a week prior, James had nearly run into Qlo on the street.  He was playing with his second sight when he saw it:  The white flame.  It was a long rectangle, a perfect band of light that stretched inside of Qlo from her hips and up her spine to her chest.</p>
            <p>That day, James’s evolution theory went out the window.  The eye could not explain the white light:  It was as though a mystical force had protected it from analysis.  And that was when James decided to forget Qlo for good.  He ran as fast as he could, desperately ignoring her cries to him.  He did not reason that perhaps Qlo had evolved just like he had.  Nor had he heeded the eye’s interpretation of the black flames orbiting the moon—that they were <i>people</i> (that was simply ludicrous).</p>
            <p>Qlo and her white flame was the only anomaly that escaped the eye’s understanding—so, it would be better to forget her.</p> 
            <p>James opened his human eyes and continued to stare at the minute hand of the clock that was so similar to the band of light in Qlo’s chest.  He quickly dug in his bag for his cell phone and opened the contacts list.</p> 
            <p>He found Qlo’s name, and highlighted, “DELETE.”</p>
